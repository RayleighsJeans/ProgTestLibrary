>> Iron For Blind People
  >> Assumptions and Clarification!
    - What kind of blind person are we talking about?
    - Are they partially blind? Color Blind?
    - Can Detect Light ? Can See blurry Images?
    - Is the Blind person an adult, elderly or a teenager?
    - Do they have any additional disabilities?
    - Where will this Iron be used? At home? or perhaps one for travel?
    - Do we have any limitation of resources?
  >> Assumptions
    - We are talking about a Complete Blind person who cannot see anything at all i.e Zero ability to see
    - The blind person is and Adult
    - They do not have any additional disabilities
    - This iron will only be used at home
    - We do not have any limitation
    
    Okay, now that I understand the problem, I’m going to tackle this in a few parts.
    First, I’ll think about who the users are and what they’re using the Iron for.
    Second, I’m going to compare existing Irons against these use cases to see where the gaps are.
    Then finally, I’m going to discuss how we can fill in these gaps
  >> Users and Customers
    - likely that they are not the only ones who are gonna be using this Iron, other potential Customers and Users are people who don't have any disability or may have some other disability
    Use Cases Well An Iron really have only two use cases
    - getting Wrinkles and Creases out of the clothes
    - drying out Damp Fabrics
    Current Product in market Their are various types of Iron in the Market like
    - Ordinary
    - Steam Iron
    - Automatic Iron
  >> Challenges
    different modes in an Iron.
    know if the Iron is heated up to the required temperature
    dangerous for a blind person to pick up the iron if its heated as they might accidentally touch the hot element
    access the Water Reservoir in An Iron
  >> Solutions
    - Iron is heated up to a certain temperature a auditory notification should be given to the user that the temperature is high enough for the particular type of cloth
    - If the water Reservoir is nearly empty it can let the user know by a auditory notification
    - IOT device we can command the iron to manage its temperature and its mode (like steam)
    - safeguards this may include automatic shut-off mechanisms to turn off the iron when not in use for a certain period, as well as built-in sensors to detect overheating
    - reservoir which is easy to fill and indicators or sensors can be provided to indicate levels and spillage of water


>> Touchscreen Table For Restaurant
  >> Clarifying Questions
    - type of restaurants (e.g. Dine-In, Quick Service etc.)? << Focus on Dine-in restaurants that are not “Fine-Dining”
    - startup or an established company like Microsoft 
    - specific customer segment (e.g. Waiter, Customer) or process (Ordering, Eating) 
  >> The Why?
    Microsoft’s mission statement is to empower individuals to achieve more with technology.
    This product fits in with Microsoft’s mission statement because as everything starts to become digital, this can help simplify some processes.
    - want simplifying the process of dine-in restaurants or making the restaurant experience more fun
    - focus on acquisition since it is a new product, look engagement metrics to ensure that users are getting value out of it
  >> Current Markets
    Let’s discuss some of the ways “touchscreen” technology is disrupting the restaurant industry currently.
    - every restaurant has an iPad that can allow you to order your food there and then a waitress will come to submit the order to ring it to the chefs.
    - pain points in that process but we should keep this in mind as the baseline 
    - User Segmentation I think this is a two sided market with the waiters/chefs on one side and the other being the customers coming in to eat
  >> Restaurant Staff
    Waiters → Need to be able to take orders, deliver orders, payment, cleaning, drinks, etc.
    Managers → Although they don’t directly do anything with table, they are involved in the overall health of the restaurant and looking for ways to become more efficient (which could potentially be done with the table)
    Customers →
    - order some food, wait for it, it arrives and they eat with their friends / family, pay the bill, leave, can be segmented in various ways but I think the best would be by frequency
    - focus on the user segment “Customers” since they are the largest market and the ones that will be interacting with the table the most
  >> Pain Points
    Option Overload → They’re given a large menu which has pages full of entrees, appetizers, drinks that can make it difficult to pick a food unless they are a regular there.
    Entertainment → Usually are talking with company but sometimes if it’s a date or people are just shy, it can be difficult conversing
    Payment → It can be hard to wave over the waiter/waitress for the bill and additionally determining how to split the bill can also be hard.
    Prioritization → I want to prioritize these solutions based on the impact they have on the user segment and also the frequency that this occurs at.
    payment is a high impact, medium frequency problem that occurs in groups
    entertainment is a low impact, medium frequency problem.
  >> Solutions / Ideas
    - Smart Tracker of Plates
      The table is divided into “virtual sections” that are visible on the table with gridlines. 1 section per person.
      There are trackers on each dish and once it enters a user’s section, it automatically bills it to that individual.
      Waiter will know exactly who had what bill making it easier to split.
      Could be hard with restaurants that have shareables etc.
  >> Automatic Payment
    - Still imagine the virtual sections for this scenario and assume that every individual puts their phone on their table and has Apple Wallet.
      The waiter would split the bill and bill it to each section. Using some next-gen technology, it automatically triggers the phone to pay the bill based on what section it is in.
      Doesn’t really solve the pain point of simplifying the payment process since the customers still have to verbally describe how to pay the bill
    - Visual Splitting Up. For each dish ordered it could show it on the table virtually. The users can select the number of paying guests at the table.
      Each dish is like a pie chart and users can drag to set % and assign it to each paying individual to split up the dish. (E.g. They could set that User 1 pays 20%, User 2 pays 40%, and user 3 pays 40%)
    - Prioritization I’d want to prioritize this based on the impact this has on the pain point, the effort it takes, how easily the users could use the product, and how much it aligns with our overall objective.
    I’d want to pursue the last solution of the Visual Splitting Up. I think it would be fairly easy and fun to use and simplifies the way users have to split up and pay the bill.
    In terms of difficulty, it’s the easiest option given the other options above and has the highest impact given the level of effort.
  >> Success Metrics
    Number of restaurants adopting this restaurant table
    Number of “parties” using this to split the bill rather than telling the waiter


>> Fridge For Kids
  >> Q
    What is this company in? - Startup exploring ideas to design fridge, or an already established fridge company
    Kids = which age group is referred to her or I can define the user segments?
    Where is the refrigerator being used (household/school/daycare)? - Household
  Assumption: I am assuming Fridge's basic function is to freeze meats/ice cream/veggies etc and store food for a longer period. It also allows people to chill drinks.
  >> User group & Use case:
    - Infant/toddlers (0-3) -
      the kids are on breast milk/formula or just beginning to eat food, but the parents are feeding them. They are not yet ready to reach the refrigerator to grab a bite. However, we could define the fridge focused on kids in this age group's needs and how parents fulfill them.
    - School Age (6-12) -
      kids in this group are more likely to get food from the refrigerator, seeing my nephew & niece reach for junk food over healthy food, I believe this fridge could shape their nutritional needs.
    - Parents/relatives -
      they are the customer and will also be the primary users of the refrigerator. Given the above user groups, I would like to focus on one user segment for kids - i.e school age. Let me know if you'd like me to focus on another segment? - No, school-age is fine.
  >> Pain points:
    When kids reach the refrigerator, 9 out 10 times pick unhealthy snacks over healthy food
    Parents often worry about kids pulling the food out and dropping glass bowls which could seriously injure kids
    Given the current situation where - Parents & kids work from home - it has increasingly become difficult for parents to track kids eating schedules and how much nutrition has gone in a day
  >> Product Vision
    A smart fridge that creates healthy eating habits for kids I could perhaps share multiple solutions for each pain point or pick one from the 3 pain points and build a solution for that? -** Pick one out of 3**
  >> Solution
    We could perhaps add gamification in the flow (cue > routine > reward):
    Point system for the kids to earn points every time they pick a healthy snack,
    Deduction of the points system - X points get deducted if unhealthy snacks are consumed more than say X a day (parent defined limit).
    Within this app that is perhaps on the fridge door, it is perhaps fingerprint/log in enabled - once kid adds the details into the screen - fridge knows who is consuming from the fridge and who should get the points allocated
  >> Criteria
    I would like to evaluate the solution against what aspect of the solution helps create healthy eating habits for kids
  >> Success Metrics
    - How many fridges sold have kids creating a login and using it every time they open the fridge door
    - How many times does a kid pick healthy snacks over junk food
    - How many times does a kid pick unhealthy snacks more than the defined rules
